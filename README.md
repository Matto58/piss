# p5.js Interactive System Simulator (piss)
A p5.js "OS" (not really, just a simulation of a fictional OS, hence the "Simulator")

## Fun fact!
The name "piss" came first; "p5.js Interactive System Simulator" is a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) of it.

Please ignore if you see some stupid code, it's very WIP.
Feel free to contribute, if you'd like to lay off some of my suffering. (so far I am the only contributor)
